        <summary>Is AK-47 allowed in India?</summary>
        <p>AI Overview
No, a civilian cannot legally own a standard AK-47 rifle in India; it's a prohibited weapon restricted to military and special forces, though rare exceptions exist for extreme cases like self-defense for individuals facing severe threats, but general licensing for civilians isn't granted, with illegal possession leading to strict penalties under the Arms Act. 
Key Points:
Prohibited Weapon: The AK-47 is classified as a prohibited firearm in India, meaning it's not available for general civilian ownership. 
Specialized Use: It's primarily used by the Indian Armed Forces and specialized police units. 
Arms Act: The possession, sale, or manufacture of illegal firearms, including AK-47s, is governed by the Arms Act, 1959, with severe penalties. 
Rare Exceptions: In extraordinary circumstances, like documented threats to life (as seen with Lal Bihari Mritak), authorities might consider exceptional licenses, but this is highly unusual and not a standard process. 
Illegal Possession: Criminals often use illegally acquired AK-47s, leading to seizures and cases under the Arms Act, highlighting the illegality for the public. 
In essence, if you are not part of the security forces, owning an AK-47 in India is generally illegal.
